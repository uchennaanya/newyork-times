          CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
          physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at
          Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing
          far beyond the world of known physics.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
          particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he
          discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A
          potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have
          infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive
          force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light
          for a prodigiously violent instant.
        </p>
        <p>
          If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the
          heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped
          mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
          irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted
          beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
        </p>
        <p>
          <q>SPECTACULAR REALIZATION;</q> Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the
          page and drew a double box around it.

            , Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they
            had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis,
            known undramatically as inflation, looked right.

            Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of
            cosmic time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers
            led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
            Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time —
            so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being
            wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a
            trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought
            smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his
            colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.

            Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though
            many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
          </p>
          <p>
            If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in
            science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing
            the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast
            realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending
            14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of
            galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose
            extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our
            own universe there might be an endless number of other universes
            bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling
            over.

          In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces
          operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle
          accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr.
          Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational
          waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity,
          should ruffle space-time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe
          expert who was not part of the team, said,
          <q>This is huge, as big as it gets.</q>

        </p>
        <p>
          The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath
          of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture of
          the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface
          of the sun.

          Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as
          Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization,

        <h2>The Theory of Inflation</h2>
        <small>
          Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation,
          which explains how the universe expanded so uniformly and so quickly
          in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.

          THE UNIVERSE is just under 14 billion years old. From our position in
          the Milky Way galaxy, we can observe a sphere that is now about 92
          billion light-years across. But there's a mystery. Wherever we look,
          the universe has an even temperature.
        </p>

        <p>
          NOT ENOUGH TIME The universe is not old enough for light to have
          traveled the vast distance from one side of the universe to the other,
          and there has not been enough time for scattered patches of hot and
          cold to mix into an even temperature.
        </p>

        <p>
          DISTANT COFFEE At a smaller scale, imagine using a telescope to look a
          mile in one direction. You see a coffee cup, and from the amount of
          steam, you can estimate its temperature and how much it has cooled.
        </p>

        <p>
          COFFEE EVERYWHERE Now turn around and look a mile in the other
          direction. You see a similar coffee cup, at exactly the same
          temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup in every
          direction, you might want to look for another explanation.
        </p>

        <p>
          STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME There has not been enough time to carry coffee
          cups from place to place before they get cold. But if all the coffee
          cups were somehow filled from a single coffee pot, all at the same
          time, that might explain their even temperature.
        </p>

        <p>
          INFLATION solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less than a
          trillionth of a second after the Big Bang, the universe expanded
          faster than the speed of light. Tiny ripples in the violently
          expanding energy field eventually grew into the large-scale structures
          of the universe.
        </p>

        <p>
          FLUCTUATION Astronomers have now detected evidence of these ancient
          fluctuations in swirls of polarized light in the cosmic background
          radiation, which is energy left over from the early universe. These
          are gravitational waves predicted by Einstein.
        </p>

        <p>
          EXPANSION Returning to our coffee, imagine a single, central pot
          expanding faster than light and cooling to an even temperature as it
          expands. That is something like inflation. And the structure of the
          universe mirrors the froth and foam of the original pot.

          Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the

          In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave
          radiation was polarized, meaning the light waves had a slight
          preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the
          gravitational waves from inflation. Such waves, squeezing space in one
          direction and stretching it in another as they go by, would twist the
          direction of polarization of the microwaves, theorists said. As a
          result, maps of the polarization in the sky should have little arrows
          going in spirals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small
          differences in the temperature of the microwaves. The group’s
          telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting thermometer.

          breakthrough.

        <h2>A Special Time</h2>
        <p>
          The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists like
          Dr. Guth, staying up late in his Palo Alto house 35 years ago,
          suspected was a special break point in the evolution of the universe.

          Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today: gravity,
          electromagnetism, and strong and weak nuclear forces. But they have
          long suspected that those are simply different manifestations of a
          single unified force that ruled the universe in its earliest, hottest
          moments.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall
          from grace, like some old folk mythology of gods or brothers falling
          out with each other. The laws of physics evolved, with one force after
          another splitting away.

          Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the

          point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat.

        <p>
          Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified state
          too long. In that case, space itself would become imbued with a
          mysterious latent energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as a
          kind of antigravity, and the universe would blow itself up. Since it
          was space itself supplying the repulsive force, the more space was
          created, the harder it pushed apart.
        </p>
        <p>
          What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least
          a trillion trillionfold — from a submicroscopic speck of primordial
          energy to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a cosmic eye-blink.
        </p>
        <p>
          Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary
          particles and radiation. All of normal cosmic history was still ahead,
          resulting in today’s observable universe, a patch of sky and stars
          billions of light-years across.

          Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting
          from Dr. Guth’s original vision suggest that inflation, once started,
          is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to a comfortable
          homey expansion, the rest of the cosmos will continue blowing up,
          spinning off other bubbles endlessly, a concept known as the
          multiverse.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not
          bother asking about going any deeper into the past.
        </p>
        <p>
          We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very
          beginning, because inflation erases everything that came before it.
          All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are swept away,
          forever out of our view.
